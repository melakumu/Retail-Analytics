This project leverages data science to help a retailer solve business problems and improve customer experience, thus increasing revenue.
In order to achieve actionable insights, I explored customer demographics, product data and transactional data. 
By employing the CRISP-DM Methodology, I first attempted to understand the business through determining the business objectives, assessing the situation and determining analysis goals.
This was followed by shaping an analytic problem from the businesses problem, which in turn laid the foundation for data verification, cleaning, integration and ultimately exploratory data analysis.
Through integrating data science methods and analytical models, I was able to: segment the customers, uncover inefficient supply against demand and understand the factors associated with increased spending.
By and large, knowing the customer better and factors that affect spending, gives the retailer the opening to reach the correct customers through targeted messaging. Moreover, the ability to forecast the right demand yields to improved customer experience and business expansion.
